The p5 D3 Cookbook
==================
The p5 D3 Cookbook is a repository of documented examples for integrating the features of [D3](http://d3js.org/) into the [p5.js library](http://p5js.org/). D3.js offers a wealth of tools for manipulating data and connecting data to visual representations. p5.js, whose goal is to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, provides a environment where users can sketch their ideas in code. Used together, these two libraries can be used for a range of applications from introducing beginners to data visualization to creating canvas-based visualizations that take advantage of D3.
